(changes processes to auto and saves file. also saves a backup of the original as *.bak)

aux_data should go in:

root@710adcc58707:/Sen2Cor-02.05.05-Linux64/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sen2cor/aux_data#

to-do:

in dockerfile, wget 

ftp://geo10.elie.ucl.ac.be/v207/ESACCI-LC-L4-ALL-FOR-SEN2COR.zip

and then extract all contents (recrusive as there are .tar files within the .zip) to the aux_data folder.

finally run and see if passes tests.

also consider switching to 'TOOLBOX' mode to see if other parsing error go away. if errors do not go away, see:
https://forum.step.esa.int/t/sen2cor-2-5-5-no-such-file--pvi-jp2/9461/6

also, here's an example for how 'find' works:

find / -type d -name 'aux_data'

/ = search enitre system (or for recursive search starting from within a directory use '.')
d = directory
name = directory name

aux data repo:
root@710adcc58707:/Sen2Cor-02.05.05-Linux64/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sen2cor/aux_data#

notes on docker commands:
"VOLUME (-v) is different from COPY and ADD because it creates a mountpiont that the host operating system can interact with." Basically a host directly and a directory within the container are synced so changes to either are reflected as a single unified state.

"""COPY accomplishes everything that VOLUME accomplishes, but does it during build time. This is necessary for configuring containers with modified config files and services such as httpd, nginx, mongodb, etc.

One setback to COPY is that it makes only the container that was copied to aware of the contents. Meaning we cannot access the contents on our host computer, or on other running docker containers, something VOLUME does."""

"ADD is exactly the same as COPY except for one distinct difference. ADD can fetch content from a URL, and if the URL content is recognized as compresssed, will uncompress the contents. It has the same setbacks that COPY has."
